 How It Works
CryptoBuddy uses a small dataset of predefined cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano). Based on user input, it applies conditional logic (`if-else`) to recommend a coin that matches the user’s goal — whether it’s long-term growth or sustainability.

Sample Usage
```bash
You: Which crypto is trending up?
CryptoBuddy: These cryptos are trending up: Bitcoin, Cardano

You: What’s the most sustainable coin?
CryptoBuddy: Invest in Cardano! It’s eco-friendly and has long-term potential!

You: Which crypto should I buy for long-term growth?
CryptoBuddy: Cardano is trending up and has a top-tier sustainability score!
